# GOGger-Wishlist
GOGger Wishlist is a program to keep tabs on game entries on your online GOG Wishlist.

GOGger Wishlist is an adaption and improvement to my older GetGOG Wishlist program, which had stopped working.

For games added to GOGger Wishlist, a few records are kept, and in some cases immediately displayed in columns and fields. This includes initial 'Start' price, subsequent price changes from checking, Game ID and game URL. Current price is displayed in the 'Last' price column. Lowest ever retrieved price is displayed in the 'Low' column, and highest in the 'High' column. Previous price is displayed in the 'Prior' column. Price checking requires a web connection, as does one optional ADD option. Titles and prices etc can also be added or checked via saved web pages.

One optional ADD feature of the program, will probably require that the user's online GOG Wishlist be set to visible for 'Everyone' in account settings.
