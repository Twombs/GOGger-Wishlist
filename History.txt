(v1.1) Improved the UPDATE button choices, and added checking for missing prices in the 'Start' and 'Prior' columns 'Corrections' choice. Implemented a new choice that compares online Wishlist entries with the program ones, and it includes duplicate checking and queried removal. Processing and dialog information has been improved and updated. Program folder can be opened via the Program Information dialog (second window).

(v1.2) A failed price query now autocloses in 6 seconds during a Check ALL, and the entry line is colored pink. Typically this occurs for unreleased games. A Log record file is now populated with price queries that have resulted in an increase or decrease or failure. On failure, gog.com is now pinged, to see if the web connection is active. If inactive price query pauses for user response. Prices that change are now shown with colors on program restart, until a Check ALL occurs.

(v1.3) When adding a game via a single URL, the ADD input keeps presenting itself until CANCEL is clicked. Added a third ADD GAME option, that borrows some code from a partially adapted version of my GetGOG Wishlist program. That option uses a web connection and GOG username, to download and extract games from the first web page of that user's online Wishlist. Any missing titles in the database are added, along with Game ID + Price + URL. 'ADD Multiple' games now has automation if saved web pages are named consecutively (i.e. GOG Wishlist_1.html and GOG Wishlist_2.html etc). That works the same with one of the UPDATE button options, and in both instances the 'Stop' checkbox can be used between pages. NOTE - Online GOG Wishlist needs to be set to visible for 'Everyone' in account settings.
